About me

Hello! I'm Tejasvi Verma, a sophomore pursuing Computer Science Engineering with a passion for web development and competitive programming. I thrive on creating sleek, user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js.

Beyond web development, I'm deeply fascinated by Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy tackling complex problem-solving challenges and honing my skills through competitive programming platforms. My goal is to leverage these skills to build efficient and scalable software solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm driven by a curiosity for learning and a commitment to mastering the latest trends in software development.
